# Kopano
Usefull scripts for Kopano

get-kopano-community.sh, this script pull the community files for your OS. 
Currently tested on Debian 9 but should work for Debian 8/Ubuntu 16/18 .04 also. 
This eliminates the use of dpkg -i *.deb on kopano-community files

It setups a local file repo, which is easy to adapt for a webserver repo, examples are provided in the files.
It also adds the z-push repo en libreoffice-online repo for you.
I've also added an autobackup function, so you can revert to a previous version if needed.

For the quick and unpatient, keep the defaults and run :
wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thctlo/Kopano/master/get-kopano-community.sh | bash
apt install kopano-server-packages

And see the new versions you can use/install: 
apt-cache policy kopano-server-packages kopano-webapp z-push-kopano libreoffice-online

Note, when you are upgrading and you see packages are "kept back". 
This is why. Kopano is fast moving at the moment, if new packages are added then these are not installed, 
when you just run apt update, in these cases you must use apt dist-upgrade.
So make sure you always check for "kept back" packages.

The script its defaults wil do following for you. 
- create a folder /home/kopano
- create a subfolder apt
- create a subfolder backups
- pulls the files for the Kopano community site.
- make a backup of the previous version to /home/kopano/backups/OS-ARCH-Date
- cleanup letovers in apt
- adds z-push repo ( /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kopano-z-push.list ) 
- adds libreoffice repo  ( /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kopano-libreoffice-online.list ) 
- setups the local-file repo ( /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kopano-community.list ) 
  the repo example file : 
  - File setup for Kopano Community :   deb [trusted=yes] file:/home/kopano/apt/ amd64/
  - Webserver setup for Kopano Community. deb [trusted=yes] http://localhost/apt amd64/
  To enable the webserver, install a webserver ( apache/nginx ) and symlink /home/kopano/apt/ to /var/www/html/apt
  Change localhost to you hostname of ip.
